Assignment 5 - Stacks for OOP


/*

    1. Messages will be between 5 and 1,000,000 units long.
    2. Messages will have groups to show which parts need to be encoded first.
    3. The character '1' will show a start of a group, and the character '2' will the end
    4. Each grouping will 3 characters.  Take the middle value will always be a vowel and the two end values will be consonants.   
    5. Instead of consonants, another grouping can replace one or both of them.   A grouping cannot replace a vowel.   
    6. You must evaluate the nested/replaced groupings.  Since 1 and 2 give you the end you can read it left to right. 
    7. The output should only have the letters inside.

basically messages will be seperated by 1 as beggining and 2 as end 

Vowels will get pushed to the end of the message 

    ex. 
    1cat2  -> cta 

    11top2e1cat22

    top2
